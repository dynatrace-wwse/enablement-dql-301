dynatrace query language advanced concepts hands-on training

## Lab Overview

During this hands-on training, we will use the Dynatrace playground with Notebooks and Dashboards to explore the following:

1. **DQL 301 - Data Transformation**: Learn how to effectively use the `join`, `lookup`, `append`, and `data` commands to combine data from multiple sources, enhancing the depth and breadth of your queries.

*Future sessions*

1.	**Data Optimization**: Optimize your DQL queries with sampling, entity usage, and timeseries data, enabling better performance monitoring and analysis.
2.	**Aggregate Complex Queries**: Explore techniques for aggregating complex queries using workflows and business events, allowing for more comprehensive data analysis and reporting.

By the end of this session, students will have a deeper understanding of advanced DQL features, empowering them to leverage Dynatrace for more sophisticated and efficient data analysis.

**Lab tasks:**

1. Import Notebook into Dynatrace Playground

2. Including Raw Data with `data`

3. Appending Additional Data with `append`

4. Connecting Data With `lookup`

5. Exploring the Entity Model and Semantic Dictionary with `describe`

6. Flexible Data Connectivity With `join`
