The mapping is accomplished by the line: <code>on:{left[dt.source_entity] == right[id]}</code>. To use an inner join, we set <code>kind:{inner}</code>. Finally, we add a prefix \"service.\" to all resulting entries. Like <code>lookup</code>, it is good practice to place the right-side mapping field (here, <code>id</code>) in the query, as well as <code>entity.name</code>. </p> <p>If there are no matches between the left (<code>A</code>) table and the right (<code>B</code>) table, then, for a <code>join</code> using <code>kind:{inner}</code>, you will have no records returned. Unlike <code>lookup</code>, <code>join</code> will match past the first record. </p> <p>Using a left outer join (i.e., <code>kind:{leftOuter}</code>) is useful for finding both matching and non-matching records, as those that do not match on the right (<code>B</code>) table will return as null. In this scenario, you are guaranteed to return some records, with null values for non-matches. </p> <p>Let's look at this for a similar version of the previous DQL logs snippet. In this case, we have adjusted the service ID with <code>concat</code> to deliberately break the matches for the right table on a <code>leftOuter</code> join.</p> <pre><code>fetch logs\n| join\n[\n  fetch dt.entity.service\n  | fieldsAdd id\n  | fieldsAdd newId = concat(id,\"1\")\n  | fieldsAdd entity.name\n], kind:{leftOuter}, on:{left[dt.source_entity] == right[newId]}, prefix: \"service.\"\n| limit 10\n</code></pre> <p>Run this with both <code>leftOuter</code> and <code>inner</code> joins. You will notice that <code>leftOuter</code> returns records with null fields while <code>inner</code> does not. </p> <p></p> <p>\u23e9 Try it out: Starting with the snippet below, modify it so that you can determine the single value percentage of EC2 instances in the environment. Hint: on your <code>summarize</code>, you will need to use a <code>countIf</code>. What happens when you change the <code>kind:</code> value for <code>join</code>?</p> <pre><code>timeseries avg(dt.host.cpu.usage), by: { dt.entity.host }\n| fieldsAdd dt.entity.host.name = entityName(dt.entity.host)\n| fieldsAdd value.A = arrayAvg(`avg(dt.host.cpu.usage)`)\n\n...\n| fields ec2Percentage\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"3-data-transformation/#continue","title":"Continue","text":"<p>In the next section, we'll wrap up what we've learned in this lab today. </p> <ul> <li>Continue To Wrap Up</li> </ul>"},{"location":"4-wrap-up/","title":"Wrap Up","text":""},{"location":"4-wrap-up/#what-you-learned-today","title":"What You Learned Today","text":"<p>You explored how to connect data using the <code>append</code>, <code>data</code>, <code>lookup</code>, and <code>join</code> commands in DQL to combine data from multiple sources. </p> <p>Understanding <code>data</code>: * The <code>data</code> command allows you to add any data into a Notebook, Dashboard, Workflow, or other DQL components. * It's useful for pulling in data from other sources like Excel or CSV files. * JSON data types are allowed.</p> <p>You explored an example of nested JSON and learned how to parse it using <code>fieldsFlatten</code> and <code>fieldsKeep</code>.</p> <p>Adding Data Sets with <code>append</code>: * The append command behaves similarly to a SQL UNION ALL operation, combining two data sets. * You learned how to use append to combine metrics and logs on the same entity.</p> <p>Understanding <code>lookup</code>: * The <code>lookup</code> command adds fields from a subquery (lookup table) to the source table by matching fields. * It mimics a SQL INNER JOIN but only returns the first matching result. * Null values in key fields are not returned. * The lookup function nests all included fields as a record.</p> <p>In addition, you explored the entity model with <code>describe</code>. The <code>describe</code> command helps you understand the data model fields present for a given entity. You can use the Dynatrace semantic dictionary to map relationships between keys in different observability facets.</p> <p>A summary of the common topologies for application, service, process, and host entities was provided to help you understand relationships in the Dynatrace data model.</p> <p>You also delved into the <code>entityAttr</code> command in DQL, which allows you to traverse the Dynatrace data model for a given entity on a particular field. Often, you may need to use <code>describe</code> to understand the fields available for the data object to be suitably used in <code>entityAttr</code>. This command enriches your queries and allows you to pass intents between apps.  </p> <p>Finally, you explored the <code>join</code> command in DQL. </p> <p>Understanding <code>join</code>:</p> <ul> <li>The join command adds fields from a subquery (set <code>B</code>, the \"right\") to the source table (set <code>A</code>, the \"left\").</li> <li>There are three types of joins: <code>inner</code>, <code>leftOuter</code>, and <code>outer</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Types of Joins:</p> <ul> <li>Inner Join (kind: inner): Returns only the matching records from both tables.</li> <li>Left Outer Join (kind: leftOuter): Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table. Non-matching records from the right table are returned as null.</li> <li>Outer Join (kind: outer): Returns all matching and non-matching records from both tables.</li> </ul> <p>By mastering these concepts, you can effectively connect and analyze data in Dynatrace, enhancing your observability and monitoring capabilities.
